Hope you are well. 

I've been swept up in jiu-jitsu. It's been a savior for my mental health. Although writing is also a boost to my mental health, it does hurt to write sometimes. Digging deep into that emotional space and ending up with words staring back at you is terrifying. I'd rather take the bumps and bruises jiu-jitsu has offered up. I'd rather not think about anything at all.

There have been a handful of things in my life that get me to that place of nothing. That holy ground of silence. There's a build-up at first. You keep thinking...

*This is hard*  
*This sucks*  
*I wonder how much longer this will go on for*  
*Why am I even doing this?*  
*Who am I to even do this?*
*Who am I at all?* 
*I hope.....*  
*I wish.....*  
*I pray.....*  
*.....*  
*........*
*This is hard*
