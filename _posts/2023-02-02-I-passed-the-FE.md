_I passed_

It feels like I've exhaled for the first time in 3 months. 

When I started studying in October, I could feel my brain resist the equations and forces. All of the vectors and stress of an undergraduate engineering education came back to me nearly 2 years after graduating, except it was somehow worse.

_I should know this stuff._

It helped when I went through my personal archive of homework from my college days and found that at some point I knew much more than these problems were asking for. That was encouraging. For the next three months I woke up at 4:45 and got an hour of studying in before work at 8 am. I had high points and low points, but in the end it paid off. Add me to the list of neverending people saying that hard work pays off. 

If someone is going through the same process I have some tips:

1. Don't use Lindeburg, it's outdated, over-the-top difficult, and discouraging
2. Use PrepFE, it relatively cheap, decent difficulty, but the question bank is low
3. Take at least one practice test (mimicking the actual environment)
4. Study even when you don't want to

There's a common misconception that you have to be motivated in order to complete a task. Although it would be nice to have motivation to complete something, if you just make up your mind to complete it regardless of how you feel, then eventually you will have sufficient willpower to override motivation. At least that's how I felt after going through this experience. Nike rings true.

_just do it_
