**I am tired.**

I've been getting 8+ hours of sleep and it feels more like 5. 

I've decided to spend my free time away from FE studying to start a blog. I'm sure there are more relaxing ways to spend this free time, but what can I say, I miss writing. There's no particular audience these posts are geared to. If you've somehow traced my virtual fingerprint to this site, welcome. Not sure where this is going, but as long as I'm alive "it" will always have to go somewhere...right?
