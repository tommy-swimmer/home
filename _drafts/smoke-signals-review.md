# Smoke Signals Review

Few things have left me as underwhelmed as reading Roger Ebert's [review](https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/smoke-signals-1998) on Smoke Signals. This is not the fault of the famous critic, but a reflection of society's understanding of who the modern American Indian was in the early 90's.
